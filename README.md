# The Simon Game

![Simon Game Preview](./simon-game-printscreen.png)

A game inspired by an electronic game Simon, which creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the sequence.

This project was created during [The Complete Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/) to practice using JavaScript library jQuery.
